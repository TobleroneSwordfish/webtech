    The project is a website for displaying live updating statistics about the game Planetside 2. Conveniently the game has an API located at http://census.daybreakgames.com/
    The server gets information from the API, stores it in a database and relays it to the client.
    We are Theano Xirouchaki (tx17079) and Jonny Hall (jh17979).
    <p>
        HTML: We have one somewhat fleshed out page and one barebones, both have been validated using an HTML validator (http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/)
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS: We have stylesheets, animations and no inline styling in the HTML file.
    </p>
    <p>
        JS: We are using client side JS to fetch data from the server at runtime and display it on the page as well as establishing a websocket connection with the
        server to receive notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
        PNG: We used Gimp to make some fanart for the game. We used filters, frames, layers, transparency, and drew with a couple weird brushes and combined images.
        The original images and gimp files can be found in folders Image1-3 and the final pngs are also in the fanart page.
    </p>
    <p>
        SVG: We used Inkscape to recreate the symbols for the three factions of the game. We used the shape tool, simplification, path editing, grouping, transformations, and patterns.
        Is there any advice you could give for how to reach A* on this?
    </p>
    <p>
        Server: The server is built from the ground up using the JS HTTP library. Async-await has been used wherever possible including promisifying the database connection.
        It acts as both a websocket client and server to communicate with the census API and client respectively.
    </p>

        Since we can't include the database in the .zip, a schema is provided in schema.sql. The server assumes that the database is
        called "webtech".
    </p>
    <p>
        Dynamic pages: The server can generate dynamic HTML pages by use of a custom embedded templating language implemented in the module "templating.js".<br>
