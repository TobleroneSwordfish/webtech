    The project is a website a fan page for the game Planetside 2. Conveniently the game has an API located at http://census.daybreakgames.com/
    The server gets information from the API, stores it in a database and relays it to the client, as well as receiving data from clients (such as pictures).
    We are Theano Xirouchaki (tx17079) and Jonny Hall (jh17979).
    <p>
        HTML: We have a number of pages. The index page displays a dynamic table of player statistics, the contents of which can be altered by the client based on a number of input elements (dropdown, tickboxes, textfield).
        The fanart page displays pictures submitted by users and approved by admins. There is a comment system where users can post comments on pictures as well as reply to others' comments.
        Admins can also access a page where they can approve artwork through the fanart page. Additionally there is an admin page where an admin can see all users and delete them in a pop-up window.
        The table of users in the admin page has multiple pages that can be navigated using hyperlink buttons at the bottom of the table, and the number of elements in the table can be changed through a dropdown menu.
        Finally, there is a nav-bar which is dynamically added to every page and lets users access the pages. This includes a login popup with a form (if the user is not logged in) or a logout button otherwise.
        They have all been validated using an HTML validator (http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/)
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS: We have stylesheets, animations in the index page and no inline styling in the HTML file. We have used css to tessalate a background picture, style buttons, hide or show overflow, make pop-ups and tooltips etc.
        The table in the index page is styled with css dynamically with js at runtime. The rows are colored based on the faction the player belongs in, and hovering over a row changes is color for ease of reading across the row.
    </p>
    <p>
        JS: We are using client side JS to fetch data from the server at runtime and display it on the page as well as establishing a websocket connection with the
        server to receive notifications. We also use it to dynamically change styling of html elements, and generate tables from the received data including splitting it into pages. 
        Eg: clicking on a table column requests data from the server sorted by that column name and sets the styling of that column to be dark to indicate it has been selected.
        Also, typing a username in the search bar and pressing enter or clicking the search button will bring up the player by that name if they are in the database. And empty search or clicking the refresh button will refresh the table with the parameters in the input fields.
        Js also supports the CSS animation on the index page's SVG logos.
    </p>
    <p>
        PNG: We used Gimp to make some fanart for the game. We used filters, frames, layers, transparency, and drew with a couple weird brushes and combined images.
        The original images and gimp files can be found in folders Image1-3 and the final pngs are also in the fanart page.
    </p>
    <p>
        SVG: We used Inkscape to recreate the symbols for the three factions of the game. We used the shape tool, simplification, path editing, grouping, transformations, and patterns.
        We then also created a set of three hexagons with gradients in the faction colors and used the tiling tool to tessalate it, export it as a png, and use it as the website's background.
        We are claiming A+ for this because we feel the SVGs are at a level where they could be in a professional website. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Server: The server is built from the ground up using the JS HTTP library. Async-await has been used wherever possible including promisifying the database connection.
        It acts as both a websocket client and server to communicate with the census API and client respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
        
        Since we can't include the database in the .zip, a schema is provided in schema.sql. The server assumes that the database is
        called "webtech".
    </p>
    <p>
        Dynamic pages: The server can generate dynamic HTML pages by use of a custom embedded templating language implemented in the module "templating.js".<br>
